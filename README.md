<b>Record Management System for Letter Of Recommendation</b><br>       
• Developed a web application using <b><i>Laravel</i></b> as the backend and <b><i>Vue Js</i></b> as the front end.<br>
• The web application streamlines the process of requesting a letter of recommendation.<br>
• The student is able to request the professor for a letter of recommendation online by giving his academic and <br>  extra-curricular details using which the professor can draft a LOR.<br>
• The student also submits the courses and universities they are applying to and their deadlines with which the system <br>  reminds professor of the deadlines.<br>
• The system also sends a feedback email to the student on completion of 150 days from the deadline.<br>
• The feedback email requests the student to go on a link where he can submit details as in which course and <br>  university he/she got accepted into and which did they choose.<br>
• By having information , such as academic and extra-curricular details and the courses students got accepted into, <br>  the system conducts data analysis such as<br>
    o	Colleges accepting students
    o	Colleges accepting students based on GRE
    o	Students opting for which courses
    o	Students getting accepted into which courses<br>
• Using such data colleges can better prepare students for higher studies.
